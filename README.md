Atlas is a self-hosted feed curating tool: scroll fast, react fast, block the junk, auto-save what is worth keeping.

Atlas is also growing into a batch downloader and personal library with lightweight streaming.

The hard part is not finding content anymore. It is filtering it fast and keeping only what matters.

Atlas is built for quick, decisive keep/nope workflows, automated cleanup, and background saves so you can move through large streams without getting buried.

**What it does**

- Fast browsing of image and video feeds at scale
- One-click reactions to keep, discard, or flag items
- Automated background downloads for the things you want to keep
- Noise reduction through moderation rules and blacklists
- Separate tabs to keep different hunting sessions distinct

**Why it is different**

Atlas is not a traditional media library manager. It is for curation from chaotic, fast-moving sources:

- Prioritizes speed over catalog perfection
- Makes "keep vs skip" the primary action
- Uses your reactions and rules to cut repeats and spam
- Designed around discovery and collection, not just playback

**Do you run into**

- Large, noisy feeds where the good stuff is buried
- Slow keep/nope workflows that make curation a chore
- Repeats, spam, or low-signal items clogging your stream
- A growing backlog without a clean way to save the best items

Atlas is built to handle these.
