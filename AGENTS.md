# Development guidelines

## Vue Composition API
- Avoid using `watch` when possible. Prefer handling state changes directly in computed setters, event handlers, or lifecycle hooks. Use `watch` only when absolutely necessary for complex reactive dependencies that cannot be handled otherwise.

## Testing
- Create tests to verify code changes.
- Run the individual test first to ensure it works.
- Run the full test suite once the feature test passes.


Under this section you will regularly update to add key references to code, class, modules that are critical to the development that will help prevent you creating duplicate implementations.
