- when in list mode and we click on a video preview, full size opens, but I want the full size to resume where the preview was playing
- check that under disliked auto, the prompt badge is running against all rules and rendering the first match or whether it is storing the id of the rule that matched it when it was disliked
- single view to photos list
- add controls to single view when video
