  - [ ] Shortcut to open sheet
  - [ ] Shortcut to react and close
  - [ ] Sometimes, clicking on an image, opens a bigger version, the filereaction widget shows at times, and sometimes not, even though the new item appears in the sheet
  - [ ] If I open the file url directly, I should still see the extension sheet and widget and ability to react .e.g blobl:https://.... the url becomes the referrer
  - [ ] when reacting, reacted cta show spinner, other ctas disabled, once complete, show reaction as active
  - [ ] reacting to an already reacted and downloaded file, prompt if to redownload before changing the reaction, confirm or cancel, will still update the reaction
  - [ ] dislike/blacklist to a file that is already downloaded, should prompt if to delete the file then proceed with the dislike/blacklist
  - [ ] Use clean dialog instead of alert
- [ ] Issues
  - [ ] Backfill old records for missing containers
  - [ ] Pill reaction does not exclude items flagged for dislike that are outside viewport (reacting from outside downloads those items)
