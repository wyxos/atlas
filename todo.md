- [ ] Dashboard
  - [ ] Disliked and Unreacted files to exclude blacklisted files
  - [ ] Need stats to showcase files that are
    - [ ] Reacted but not on disk
    - [ ] Unreacted but on disk (Not downloaded, source local)
    - [ ] Downloaded but not on disk
    - [ ] Downloaded but not reacted
- [x] Extension
  - [x] Ability to delete download
  - [x] Ability to blacklist
  - [x] Outline links that were already visit/reacted when present
  - [x] Outline/border files that were already reacted with the relevant color
  - [x] Shortcut to open sheet
  - [x] Shortcut to react and close
  - [x] Sometimes, clicking on an image, opens a bigger version, the filereaction widget shows at times, and sometimes not, even though the new item appears in the sheet
  - [x] If I open the file url directly, I should still see the extension sheet and widget and ability to react .e.g blobl:https://.... the url becomes the referrer
  - [x] when reacting, reacted cta show spinner, other ctas disabled, once complete, show reaction as active
  - [x] reacting to an already reacted and downloaded file, prompt if to redownload before changing the reaction, confirm or cancel, will still update the reaction
  - [x] dislike/blacklist to a file that is already downloaded, should prompt if to delete the file then proceed with the dislike/blacklist
  - [x] Use clean dialog instead of alert
  - [x] Tested: `vendor/bin/pint --dirty`, `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExtensionFilesCheckTest.php tests/Feature/ExtensionFilesStoreTest.php tests/Feature/ExtensionFilesReactTest.php tests/Feature/ExtensionFilesDeleteDownloadTest.php`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build:extension`, `npm run test -- resources/js/utils/file.test.ts`
- [ ] Issues
  - [ ] Backfill old records for missing containers
  - [ ] Pill reaction does not exclude items flagged for dislike that are outside viewport (reacting from outside downloads those items)
