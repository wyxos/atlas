## Code Quality and Testing Requirements

### Quality Checks (MUST run after each task)
- **Use the check script**: Run `npm run check` (or `node scripts/check.mjs`) after completing each task to ensure code quality.
- The check script automatically:
  - Runs TypeScript type checking
  - Auto-fixes and checks JavaScript/TypeScript linting (ESLint with --fix)
  - Auto-fixes and checks PHP linting (Laravel Pint)
  - Runs JavaScript tests (Vitest)
  - Runs PHP tests (Pest)
- **ALL failures must be addressed**, even if they are unrelated to the recent task. The check script must pass completely before considering a task complete.
- If any check fails, investigate and fix the issues before proceeding.

### Workflow Order
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run check` (this handles linting with auto-fix, type checking, and testing)
3. Fix any remaining errors (the script auto-fixes what it can)
4. Re-run `npm run check` to verify everything passes
5. Only then consider the task complete
