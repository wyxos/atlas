## Code Quality and Testing Requirements

### Quality Checks (MUST run after each task)
- **Selective check scripts**: Use the appropriate check script based on the type of changes made:
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue changes only**: Run `npm run check:js` (or `tsx scripts/check-js.ts`)
    - Runs TypeScript type checking
    - Auto-fixes and checks JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue linting (ESLint with --fix)
  - **PHP changes only**: Run `npm run check:php` (or `tsx scripts/check-php.ts`)
    - Auto-fixes and checks PHP linting (Laravel Pint)
    - Runs PHP tests (Pest)
  - **Both JavaScript and PHP changes**: Run `npm run check` (or `tsx scripts/check.ts`)
    - Runs all checks: TypeScript type checking, JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue linting, PHP linting, JavaScript tests (Vitest), and PHP tests (Pest)
- **ALL failures must be addressed**, even if they are unrelated to the recent task. The check script must pass completely before considering a task complete.
- If any check fails, investigate and fix the issues before proceeding.

### UI/UX Design Guidelines (MUST follow)
- **Always refer to the UI/UX Guidelines**: When implementing any UI elements, components, or styling, refer to `/guidelines` route for the design system.
- The guidelines page (`resources/views/guidelines.blade.php`) defines:
  - Color palette (Smart Blue, Sapphire, Regal Navy, Prussian Blue, and neutral colors)
  - Typography styles and hierarchy
  - Button styles (Primary, Outline, Ghost) and sizes
  - Form input styling with dark theme
  - Table styling
  - Link styles
- **Dark Theme**: The application uses a dark theme by default:
  - Background: Prussian Blue (#001233)
  - Card backgrounds: Darker shade (#000e29)
  - Text: Light colors from the palette (900 shades for headings, 700-900 for body)
  - Borders: Twilight Indigo (#33415c)
- **Color Usage**:
  - Primary actions: Smart Blue (#0466c8)
  - Secondary actions: Sapphire (#0353a4)
  - Headings: Smart Blue 900 (#c3e0fe) or Regal Navy 900 (#b4d8fe)
  - Body text: Twilight Indigo 900 (#d0d7e5)
  - Borders/separators: Twilight Indigo (#33415c)
- Match the styling patterns, color usage, and component structure shown in the guidelines page.

### Testing Requirements (MUST create/update tests)
- **JavaScript/Vue Tests**: For any task that involves creating or modifying JavaScript or Vue code, you MUST create or update corresponding tests in the `resources/js` directory (using Vitest).
  - Test files should follow the naming pattern: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.js`
  - Tests should cover the functionality you've implemented or modified
  - Use Vitest's testing utilities and assertions

- **PHP Tests**: For any task that involves creating or modifying PHP code, you MUST create or update corresponding tests.
  - Use Pest for all PHP tests
  - **Unit Tests**: Use unit tests (`php artisan make:test --unit`) ONLY if the PHP code does NOT use Laravel features (facades, Eloquent, database, HTTP, etc.) or database operations
  - **Feature Tests**: Use feature tests (`php artisan make:test --pest`) for code that uses Laravel features, database operations, HTTP requests, or any framework functionality
  - Tests should cover the functionality you've implemented or modified
  - Follow existing test patterns and conventions in the `tests` directory

### Frontend Verification (MUST verify before completion)
- **Browser Testing**: For any task that involves frontend changes (UI components, styling, Vue components, CSS, etc.), you MUST use browser MCP server and/or Playwright to visually verify the changes before marking the task as complete.
- Navigate to the relevant pages, take screenshots, and verify that:
  - The changes render correctly
  - Styling matches the design guidelines (if applicable)
  - Interactive elements work as expected
  - The UI matches the intended design
- Do not mark frontend tasks as complete without visual verification in a real browser environment.

### Authentication and Testing
- **Demo Credentials**: When testing pages behind authentication or using browser tools to verify authenticated pages, use the demo credentials from the seeder.
- Check `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` for the current demo/test credentials. Use the credentials defined there for all authenticated testing scenarios.
- Do not hardcode credentials in rules or documentation - always reference the seeder file as the source of truth.

### Workflow Order
1. Make code changes
2. Create or update tests for the changes (JS/Vue tests for JS/Vue code, PHP tests for PHP code)
3. For frontend changes: Use browser MCP server and/or Playwright to visually verify the changes
4. Run the appropriate check script:
   - `npm run check:js` for JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue changes only
   - `npm run check:php` for PHP changes only
   - `npm run check` for both JavaScript and PHP changes
5. Fix any remaining errors (the script auto-fixes what it can)
6. Re-run the appropriate check script to verify everything passes
7. Only then consider the task complete
