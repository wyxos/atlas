## Code Quality and Testing Requirements

### Linting (MUST run before tests)
- **Laravel Pint**: Run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing any changes. Fix ALL linting errors, regardless of whether they are related to the current task.
- **JavaScript Linting**: If a JavaScript linter (ESLint, etc.) is configured, run it before finalizing changes. Fix ALL linting errors, regardless of whether they are related to the current task.
- Linting errors must be fixed before proceeding to tests.

### Testing (MUST run after each task)
- **PHP Tests**: Run `php artisan test` after completing each task to ensure no regressions.
- **JavaScript Tests**: Run `npm test -- --run` (Vitest) after completing each task to ensure no regressions.
- **ALL test failures must be addressed**, even if they are unrelated to the recent task. The test suite must be green before considering a task complete.
- If tests fail, investigate and fix the issues before proceeding.

### Workflow Order
1. Make code changes
2. Run linting (Laravel Pint + JS linting if configured)
3. Fix any linting errors
4. Run test suites (PHP + JS)
5. Fix any test failures
6. Only then consider the task complete
